This repo is a firebase-testing intended for firestore. To test if Firestore is working properly:

1. clone the repo
2. this repo uses a viewmodel to create new firestore records. Go to `ViewModel.swift`, change the init function for a new record
3. to add the record, run the app. The output should be "added successfully"
